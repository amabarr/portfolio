  Amanda Barrafato's Portfolio
</h1>

Hi, I'm Amanda Barrafato. I am a musician, audio engineer and fullstack engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.

I started playing the guitar at eight years old, and had big dreams to become a heavy metal guitar goddess. I also loved to mess around with computers, and electronics and found myself making a MIDI guitar in college using Arduino. My ideal position is a combination of my two passions in life: music and technology.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, curled up reading a book next to my cat Lucas, at a concert, playing dungeons and dragons, or playing an RPG.

# Technologies

This portfolio was made using Gatsby, React, TypeScript, raw CSS, and deployed with Netlify.
